pyNFFT - Cython wrapper around the NFFT library
===============================================

"The NFFT is a C subroutine library for computing the nonequispaced discrete
Fourier transform (NDFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size,
and of complex data."

The NFFT library is licensed under GPLv2 and available at:
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/index.php

This wrapper provides a somewhat Pythonic access to some of the core NFFT 
library features and is largely inspired from the pyFFTW project developped by 
Henry Gomersall (http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/).
